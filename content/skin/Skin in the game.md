In this section, I'll note all the quantitative decisions I have made in the areas of investing, trading and betting.

Skin in the game or put in another way - putting where your mouth aligns with my core belief. Any serious analysis that I feel strongly about should have a stake in the game.

Also, I'm of the view that if you make enough calculated bets with positive expected returns in your life, eventually it will be a net positive in the long run.
