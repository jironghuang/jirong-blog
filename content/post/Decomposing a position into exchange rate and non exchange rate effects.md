## Decomposing a Position Into Exchange Rate and Non Exchange Rate Effects

If you are someone with a stake in foreign positions, this package I wrote here may be a useful tool to help you understand the impact of foreign currency on your positions. For instance,

- If you are an investor, you may use it to analyze impact of exchange rate on your investment positions.
- If you are in the treasury department, you may wish to analyze the impact of exchange rates on your bonds.
- If you are in the finance department, you could analyze the exchange rate impact on your foreign revenue.

To start using this package, you may first install the devtools package and execute the following command. install_github("jironghuang/RemoveExchangeRateEffects").

You may follow the example to better understand how this package works. 

In summary, what the example does below is to decompose 1 instrument position in SGD (column value) - from the perspective of someone staying in Singapore - into local static value (i.e if I keep the exchange rate constant at the start of the period) and the residual exchange rate impact. 

If you look at the value at the end of the period (Oct 2018), you would notice that the value in SGD fell from 331 to 261. From the perspective of a Singaporean local - through this package -  we can understand that the appreciation in USD negate the fall in value by 4 SGD.       

Note: If you are interested in the codes used to develop the package, you may visit the following link https://github.com/jironghuang/RemoveExchangeRateEffects

## Quick example in R codes

```
library(devtools)
install_github("jironghuang/RemoveExchangeRateEffects")
library(RemoveExchangeRateEffects)

sp_exch_rate_pair = "USDSGD=X"  #exchange rate pair. e.g "USDSGD=X". "<Foreign_currency><local_currency>=X"

ap_start_date <- as.Date("1950-01-01")  #starting date of portfolio e.g. 2017-10-01
ap_end_date <- as.Date("2020-10-01") #ending date of portfolio e.g. 2020-10-01. If you include a date beyond current date, the function will use the current date instead
np_mthly_yearly = "monthly"  #alternatively this could be "yearly""

data(instrument) #example dataset that I included in this package
dp_dates_investment_value = instrument
o_exchRate_effect <- exchange_rate_decomposition(sp_exch_rate_pair, ap_start_date, ap_end_date, np_mthly_yearly, dp_dates_investment_value)
o_exchRate_effect$get_portfolio()
```
