<h2>Warren Buffett the sage</h2>
<p>It’s always interesting to understand investment gurus’ thought process. And one of the ways is to look at their companies’ balance sheet.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett, the Sage &amp; CEO of Berkshire, in recent decade has always been known to hoard cash. And before the 2008 crisis, he held cash level of 40-50% relative to its equity - probably trying to stay out of the overvalued market and waiting for the right opportunity to swoop in for a ‘Big CAtch’. And his efforts (or no effort) paid off. He made huge bets on companies like Goldman Sachs when prices are really depressed. And he was rewarded handsomely.</p>
<p>At the moment, his cash level ratios for both cash/equity &amp; cash/asset are on the low side - suggesting that the markets aren’t overvalued. And he’s willing to stay invested in the market.</p>
<p>That being said, there’re few factors in play,</p>
<ul>
<li>As your assets grows, it may be really hard to maintain a high proportion of cash since opportunity of holding cash is really high!</li>
<li>Types of business will affect your appetite to hold cash. Insurance business, for instance requires more cash for payout during disasters and calamaties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the near future, I will probably integrate this quarterly earnings and display the charts as an interactive dashboard - hosting live on the cloud.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honestly, the time series here is a bit disjointed. But I guess it still yields some useful information.</li>
<li>I painstakingly keyed in the numbers from gurufocus.com (can’t extract the numbers from the chart)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>dat = read.csv(&quot;berkshire_fin_statement.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F)
dat$cash_over_asset = round(100 * (dat$cash / dat$asset),1)
dat$cash_over_equity = round(100 * (dat$cash / dat$equity), 1)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
dat_long = melt(dat, id = c(&quot;year&quot;))
dat_long = subset(dat_long, dat_long$variable == &quot;cash_over_asset&quot; |
                    dat_long$variable == &quot;cash_over_equity&quot;)

ggplot(data = dat_long,
       aes(x = year, y = value, colour = variable)) +
       geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2017, 2)) +
       labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;,y=&quot;Percentage&quot;)</code></pre>
