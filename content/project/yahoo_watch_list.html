<p>In my Ubunutu - Linux laptop, I wrote some R scripts to crawl the yahoo financial data. When the clock strikes midnight, my cronjob task scheduler will execute these scripts in a parallel fashion to extract the data.</p>
<p>Then my script will log into my google account via SSH and paste into 1 of the googlesheet tabs. And this is linked to my portfolio allocation, computation and milestones.</p>
<p>It also serves as a watchlist for me to monitor which of these ETFs are undervalued via % fall from 52 week high. See my linkedin article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/investment-compass-our-volatile-times-jirong-huang/">here</a> for further explanation on why I think this is a good indicator.</p>
<p>You may find my R scripts <a href="https://github.com/jironghuang/personal-finance">here</a>. I didn’t really document this repo well so do approach me if you’ve any questions.</p>
<p>And here’s the googlsheet (updated daily) opened to the public. Hope you find it useful!</p>
