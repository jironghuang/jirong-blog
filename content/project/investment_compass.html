<h2>Investment Compass (Kindly wait 10 seconds for the entire app to load. Best viewed in Desktop)</h2>
<p>This serves as a compass for me to visualize the potential returns given the % fall from 52 week high. See my linkedin article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/investment-compass-our-volatile-times-jirong-huang/">here</a> for further explanation on why I think this is a good indicator.</p>
<p>The app consists of 3 tabs. The ‘Visualize’ tab contains 3 graphs plotting % fall from 52 week high against the expected returns 1 to 3 years later. And the value boxes are simply the fitted values from the best fit lines.</p>
<p>The second tab contains the description of the indexes. For eg. ^STI refers to Straits Times Index. It will be useful for selection of the Index under Visualization tab.</p>
<p>The third tab is just a summary of the Linkedin article.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in reading the codes, pls visit my github <a href="https://github.com/jironghuang/investment_compass">link</a>. At the moment, the lagging of indicators are done in a grossly inefficient way because I was just cobbling together some codes I did in the past. Will optimize it by using parallelized functions like mclapply in the future (used for crawling the stock process but not the computation).</p>
