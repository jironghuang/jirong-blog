# Biography

I'm a versatile analyst that understands the supply chain of Analytics: 1.) Sourcing for raw data (Web-Crawling, Social Media APIs) 2.) Database (SQL) 3.) Analysis (Statistics, Econometrics, Machine-Learning) and 4.) Delivery (Interactive Data visualizations, Automated Reports, Intranet). In addition, I possess strong project-management and communication skills essential in delivering results to stakeholders. 

As a curious & keen learner, I strive to improve myself through structured and unstructured learning. 

I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Masters in Georgia Institute of Technology. I believe this complements my background in economics, statistics, finance and computer science - as a graduate from NUS Msc. in Statistics, SMU Bsc. Economics & Finance, Uni of Adelaide Gdip in CS, as well as an analytics practitioner. 

Given that that issues are increasingly complex, I embrace a multidisciplinary approach in analysing and understanding issues; I'm passionate about data analytics, economics, finance, organisational behaviour and programming.

Over the course of my career, I hope to stay insatiably curious by thinking, learning, experimenting, coding and writing more! My goal of being a polymath is distant but I hope to move closer to it every single day. 

Through this blog, I hope to share my thoughts on analytics and quantitative trading. The latter is something I hope to work on - hopefully with some skin in the game - over the next few years.
